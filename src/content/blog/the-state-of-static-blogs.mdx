## Introduction

Hello! My name is enscribe, and I'm a fullstack web developer who has been fiddling with blogging platforms for a couple of years now. I run a blog at [enscribe.dev](https://enscribe.dev), where I write about cybersecurity and the capture-the-flag (CTF) scene.

I have a lot of opinions about what makes a great blogging template. As a cumulative result of all the slop, bullshit, and outright terrible design decisions I've had to deal with working with various templates and frameworks, I bring you [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite), which should hopefully bring a better developer and user experience in terms of ease of use, customization, and performance.

astro-erudite is written in Astro, a framework hyperoptimized for static content such as blogs. Within the codebase of this template I've included many nuances that, in my opinion (and there will be many, many opinions here), make the developer experience significantly more pleasant. I've also _excluded_ many features that, frankly, you don't need.

### Welcoming some features

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) is a pretty controversial component library. I love it. The best part is arguably its take on [theming](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming), which introduces a convention involving CSS colors such as `background` and `foreground` into your Tailwind configuration so that styling is a breeze. These classes also automatically adapt to the user's selected theme, and as such you don't need to worry about adding an equivalent `dark:` style to all of your theming. shadcn/ui turns `"bg-neutral-50 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-50"` into `"bg-background text-foreground"`, both more semantic and easier to blanket edit (if you wanted to change all your blues in your site to indigos, you would need to go around every single class and change it rather than editing a single CSS variable). Other utiliy colors such as `secondary`, `muted`, `accent`, and `destructive` also exist and are very self-explanatory in name (and also have an equivalent `-foreground` class, e.g. `secondary-foreground`, which you can apply to text on top of these colors).
- [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) is a plugin that automatically styles any content surrounded by an `<article>{:html}` tag in a way which makes it readable and blog-post-friendly. It does this via a `prose` class which you can wrap anything with to style the interior content. This is especially useful for HTML you don't control, e.g. a post rendered from Markdown. Although your control over the rendering is a bit less fine-grained, you're also already using Tailwind so this right has long been forsaken.
- [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) is a syntax highlighter for code blocks. Although Astro code blocks utilize Shiki under the hood, I've actually disabled the default code blocks in this template so that they don't collide with my preferred library [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev), which is _also_ powered by Shiki but allows for line numbers, line highlighting, inline code snytax highlighting, and a transformers API for advanced customization such as manual `diff` visualization and line blurring. This library does not ship with any CSS, and it's up to you to style the code blocks and code block titles as you see fit. I've provided styles in `src/styles/global.css` within the `@layer components{:css}` directive if you wish to fiddle with them:

  ```css title="src/styles/global.css" caption="Styling code blocks using rehype-pretty-code (with a caption down here)" showLineNumbers{80} {10-12} /pre/
  @layer components {
    code[data-theme*=' '] span {  /* [!code ++] */
      color: var(--shiki-light); /* [!code ++] */
    } /* [!code ++] */

    .dark code[data-theme*=' '] span {  /* [!code --] */
      color: var(--shiki-dark); /* [!code --] */
    } /* [!code --] */

    pre {
      @apply max-h-[600px] overflow-auto rounded-xl border bg-secondary/20 p-4 text-sm leading-loose;
    }
  ```

  The following snippet was generated with this Markdown code:

  ````mdx
  ```css title="src/styles/global.css" caption="Styling code blocks using rehype-pretty-code (with a caption down here)" showLineNumbers{80} {10-12} /pre/

  ```
  ````

  When I added those two diff additions and deletions, I simply added `/* [!code ++] */` and `/* [!code --] */` to the lines I wanted to highlight. Just use the comment syntax of whatever language you're attempting to highlight.

### Foregoing some slop

- Goodbye, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)! There have been so many occasions where I've had to deal with blogging templates with in-built pre-commit hooks which enforce contrived and arbitrary linting rules that, frankly, I couldn't be bothered with. Obviously, linting is awesome for ensuring consistency and best practice, but that's with shared and large codebases. You're dealing with, at most, your mediocre MDX blog posts and some interior fetching. It's just not worth the hypertension.

- You really don't need analytics via [Umami](https://umami.is) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io). Let's be realistic: for many personal blogs, unless you're an anime profile picture Twitter microcelebrity and/or the daughter of Taylor Swift you don't need to know how many of your avid fans click Big Button A versus how many click Big Button B.
- You really don't need a comments section via [Giscus](https://giscus.app). This opens up a can of worms involving the ability to spam comments and the necessity to moderate them. If you want organic discussion about your blog posts to happen, then share on social media and let people discuss there.
  - Speaking of sharing on social media, let's get rid of the share buttons. Please inform me of a single time you have used a share button on a blog post.
- You really don't need a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> unless you have thousands of posts and/or are willing to navigate through a clunky management interface. Markdown and folders is really all you need, which you can organize to your preference via folder or file naming conventions.
- If you have literally anything involving an `.env` file in a blog post, please reconsider what you are doing.
- Please do not override the browser's <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> functionality to open up a command palette. There should not be a single reason why a user would use a small context menu to browse your blog over the `/blog` route. Most of the time, command palettes on sites do nothing more than regurgitate shortcuts that are already on the same page you're hiding with the palette's modal.
