## astro-erudite

astro-erudite is an opinionated, no-frills static blogging template built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Extraordinarily loosely based off the [Astro Micro](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/) theme by [trevortylerlee](https://github.com/trevortylerlee).

To learn more about why this template exists, read [The State of Static Blogs in 2024](https://astro-erudite.vercel.app/blog/the-state-of-static-blogs), where I share my take on what constitutes a great blogging template and my goals while developing this one.
